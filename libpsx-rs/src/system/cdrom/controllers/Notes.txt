CDROM Notes

Reading sequence:

1. Setup MSF etc.
2. Sends read command (int #1).
3. Reads sector into local buffer, when done, sends interrupt (read command int #2).
   - Data FIFO not filled yet.
4. CPU sends pause (int #1).
5. Data FIFO filled with buffer contents [repeat].
6. Wait until buffer exhausted AND data FIFO is empty.
7. Send pause command int #2.

Subsequent sectors follow same procedure. 

Need to ensure these conditions before raising the pause command int #2:
- DMAC has fully read the Data FIFO; AND
- DMAC has stopped the CDROM transfer.
